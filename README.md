# DartRay

##Overview

DartRay is a free, open-source physically based ray tracer, providing a variety
of rendering, lighting and material algorithms.

DartRay port of the PBRT renderer (www.pbrt.org).

##Caveats
DartRay provides a test-bed for various rendering algorithms. 
The primary (and perhaps only) objectives of DartRay are experimentation, 
learning, and most important, fun. While it is perfectly capable of producing 
incredible images, it has a lot of things going against it to be thought of as 
anything remotely close to production worthy. On the positive side, Dart is
a great environment for experimentation and learning about rendering techniques.
It provides a reasonably fast and flexible, cross-platform environment for
experimentation and learning. And, most importantly, it's fun!
